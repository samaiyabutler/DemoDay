    <h2>As an only child who lives in Englewood with parents who care, I've barely been through anything. I would'nt say that I'm sheltered, but I've learned things alot of my peers have'nt even heard of. I got where I've been because of my family, friends, friends who became enemies & enemies who became friends. I am who I am today because of them & everyone I've associated myself with.</h2>

    <h2>I'm going to be very successful. I'm getting there because of my motivation & determination. If it wasnt for myself. I wouldnt be anything I am today or what I will be in the future.</h2>
